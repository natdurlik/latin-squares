# Latin squares

This project generates all reduced latin squares of size n. Then, for every reduced latin square, mutually orthogonal sequence of latin squares (mols) with first row equal 1,2,...,N is generated - for simpicity, it is not necessarily the longest possible. Sample outputs for n=4 are shown in [all reduced](o4.txt) and [mutually orthogonal](r4.txt).
